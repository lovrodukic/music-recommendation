# testing/
This directory contains reference code and experimentation for recommendation
systems based on notebook experimentation:

- `recommender_als.py`: Code for Alternating Least Squares (ALS) experimentation
- `recommender_svd.py`: Code for Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  experimentation

These files are primarily for reference and experimentation purposes. The main
logic for the recommendation system is implemented in
`models/recommender_system.py`.
